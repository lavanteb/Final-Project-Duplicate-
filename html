    <p>T<font size="10">The Fourth Phase: Travis Rice's new snowboard film is a gorgeous (and horrifying) masterpiece</font></p>

    <p><font size=6>By: Nate Scott | October 5, 2016
The best scene in The Fourth Phase, the new 92-minute snowboarding film starring Travis Rice, does not feature a snowboard. The setting is Russia. Rice, along with fellow snowboarders Mark Landvik and Eric Jackson, has been holed up along with two helicopter pilots for over four weeks in a cabin, waiting for a break in the weather. They are about to lose their minds.</font></p>

                <blockquote>A Crowley Lake, California native, he has snowboarding engrained his blood. Coming up into the big mountains with his older brother John, he is full of adventure and wonderment. That sense of adventure took the Jackson "Brothers on the Run" from Alaska to Chile on the road trip of a lifetime.</blockquote>
